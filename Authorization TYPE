FOR OAuth - Open Authorization (OAuth) is a standard, token-based protocol for authorization.

OAuth is an open protocol that authorizes a client application to access data from a protected resource through the exchange of tokens. OAuth tokens are essentially permissions given to a client application. The resource server can validate the tokens and allow the client application access to the defined protected resources. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR OAuth 2.0
OAuth 2.0 - access token is a session Id

OAuth Endpoint: OAuth endpoints are the URLs that you use to make OAuth authorization requests to Salesforce.

Authorization: i.e end user granted access. "Authorisation code" is used to obtain Access Tokean and Refresh token.

Access Token: Insted of using user's salesforce credential, a connected app can use access token to grant access to resources on behalf of the user.

Authorization Server: 
The authorization server is the server that authorizes a resource owner.


Consumer Key: A consumer uses a key to identify itself to Salesforce. Referred to as client_id in OAuth 2.0.

Consumer Secret : A consumer uses a secret to establish ownership of the consumer key. Referred to as client_secret in OAuth 2.0.

Refresh Token: Only used in OAuth 2.0, a consumer can use a refresh token to obtain a new access token, without having the end user approve the access again.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR "OAuth 1.0.A"
OAuth 1.0 - access token must be exchange for session ID

Request Token: Only used in OAuth 1.0.A, a consumer (connected app) can use a request token to obtain authorization from the end user. It exchanges the token for an access token.

Token Secret: A consumer uses this secret to establish ownership of a given token, both for request tokens and access tokens.
